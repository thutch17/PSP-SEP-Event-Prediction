Github repository to house the data collection and model code for the research project "Solar Energetic Particle Event Prediction
Using Deep Learning and Parker Solar Probe Data". All code was run on Princeton University's Stellar compute cluster. The ~8000 SDO
images are too large to be stored here, but the generated h5 file that the models use can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1op7nG-XlHzoQqb1v0J_XMF7LqGV5tsqv?usp=sharing). For any questions
or the paper, please reach out to tatehutchins@princeton.edu.
